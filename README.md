# Authentication Task – Full Task Documentation

## ⚠️ Safari Cookie Limitation

When testing the app on **Safari**, you may face issues with the `refresh_token` cookie not being saved.  
This happens because Safari blocks **cross-site cookies** by default if the frontend and backend are served from **different domains**.

- On Chrome/Edge/Firefox → Everything works as expected.
- On Safari → You need to disable **"Prevent cross-site tracking"** from:  
  `Safari > Preferences > Privacy > Prevent cross-site tracking`.

### How to Fix in Production

This is not an implementation issue. The problem will be solved automatically once both the **frontend** and **backend** are hosted under the same domain (e.g., `api.example.com` and `app.example.com`).

## Overview

This project implements a complete **Authentication System** with both **Backend** and **Frontend** integration.  
It includes features such as signup, login, token refresh, session management, and secure route protection.  
The backend is powered by **NestJS, TypeScript, MongoDB (local via Docker)**, and the frontend is built with a **React-based atomic structure**.  
The project also provides a **Swagger API documentation** and is deployed for live testing.

## Backend

### Tech Stack

- **NestJS** (TypeScript)
- **MongoDB** (local, containerized with Docker)
- **Swagger** (API documentation)
- **Security Middleware**
  - Helmet
  - Cookie Parser
  - Throttler (rate limiting)
  - CORS configuration

## Frontend

### Features

- **Route Protection**

  - If a user tries to access any route, authentication and authorization are verified.
  - If logged in and navigates to `login`/`signup`, they are redirected to the dashboard.
  - If not authenticated, accessing protected routes redirects them back to `login`.

- **Atomic Design Structure**
  - Organized and scalable folder structure for components.

---

## Deployment

- **Frontend:** [Vercel Deployment](https://auth-frontend-eight-zeta.vercel.app/)
- **Backend:** [Render Deployment](https://auth-backend-v6f5.onrender.com)

  > ⚠️ Note: The Render free instance spins down with inactivity, which can delay requests by \~50 seconds.
